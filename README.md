# Django Note App API

A RESTful API for CRUD operations on a DB for a note-making app. (WIP)

## Getting started

### Requisites

* Python

* A package manager such as [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

Installation instructions provided below will be for, specifically, pipenv. By default, the CORS middleware is coded to expect requests from `http://localhost:3000`

### Installation

From the root directory of this project:

`$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt`

### Running on local (development)

```shell
$ pipenv shell
$ python noteapprestapi/manage.py runserver
```

By default, this will launch the development server in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
